Observations:
Old benches and birdhouse
Trash around rim of pond
The water is, in general, dirty
The trees don’t add much to the scenery

Interview Notes:
Interview 1:
Like: the nature aesthetic of the pond, and it’s a nice view
Dislike/Critique: the pond could be cleaner, the island isn’t a pleasing addition, and there’s a great amount of algae buildup
Best Experience: walking to class and looking at the water, which is very relaxing
Interactions: doesn’t interact with the pond, but would love to, in the form of swimming, boating, ice skating, etc.
Interview 2:
Like: the ducks
Dislike/Critique: it’s dirty, and the trees need to be cleaned up
Interactions: only interaction is walking by it

From these two interviews, it can be concluded that the pond isn’t something hated by the two clients; in fact, they love the natural scene it brings to the campus. But they do agree that things need to change for them to get the most out of the pond, i.e. more developed ways to interact with it as well as a serious cleanup.


Needs Statement:
The students need a way to get the most out of the pond but the pond itself is what prevents them from interacting with it.
